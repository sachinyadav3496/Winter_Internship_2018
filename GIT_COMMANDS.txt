Git Cheat Sheeet


step1) first of all create a repository on your git hub account

than open powershell and go to your code folder 


# git init --> it initlize your current folder  as a git repository
# vim README.md --> overview or discreption of your repository
# git config --global user.name gitusername
# git config --global user.email git email address
config command will configure your credentials over git repository and if you
used --global it will apply to all repository current or future

#git add . --> it will add all files from current repository
#git status --> staging area, where we can which files are added and which are
still to be added at git staging area
#git commit -m "any message regarding changes" --> This will create a version
for your git repository, every time you commit something you are creating a
new version of your code

#git remote add origin https://gihub.com/username/project_name.git --> it will
link your online repository to offline repository with name origin, so every
time you write origin in this current directory meas you are reffering to
https://github.com/username/project-name.git

#git push origin master --> It will upload all of your local data files to
your remote repository ( internet connection required )

#git pull origin master --> It will fetch all the changes that has been
commited to your directory  

--> if you have an error of unrelated histories than follow this step
#git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
#git status --> see which files has conflict issues ( see red files )
#git add . --> make sure you have reviewed your changes and merged all changes
#git commit -m "message" --> to acknowledge your changes as well as merges"
#git push origin master --> origin is remote destination where we want to upload our files and master is your main branch


---> if you have large files more than 100MB than you need to configure GIT-LFS account

step1) search for the git lfs download page on google
step2) download git_lfs.exe program and install it in windows with default permission
step3) open command shell ( powershell ) and type command git install lfs to tell git to use lfs
